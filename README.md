# MoMA-dataset-exploration

This repostory present a couple of Jupyter Notebooks whose objective is to clean and explore the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) dataset. In addition, we developed a little crawler to download the image's artworks (which could be useful to train some CNN)


## Artist dataset

This dataset contains all the data related to the authors of each artwork that belongs to the museum's heritage.
Here a couple charts to show the distribution of the data.
